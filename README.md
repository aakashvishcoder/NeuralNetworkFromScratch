# Neural Network From Scratch

## General Process & Overview

<p>One of the first obsessions I've had was Neural Networks and Machine Learning. I've learned how to implement Neural Networks using libraries such as <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> or <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>. However, through using these libraries, I lacked a deeper understanding on how each component of a Neural Network interconnect to make a model that can predict based off of data. As a result, I came up with the idea of recreating a Neural Network from scratch.</p>
<p>To make this project, I first planned out each component I would try to recreate: <b>activation layers</b>, <b>loss/cost functions</b>, <b>gradient descent</b>, and more. Then I translated the math into code and organized it for easy use. The Neural Network is implemented in a list-like manner, where each layer can be added sequentially.</p>

## Complications

<p>Creating a Neural Network from scratch is a big undertaking, as having a greater understanding of how they work could be a daunting task. As expected, this project required a lot of research and hours spent learning about each component. Additionally, creating this Neural Network architecture required an understanding of multivariable calculus as we had to implement <b>gradient descent</b> which requires the use of partial derivatives. </p>
